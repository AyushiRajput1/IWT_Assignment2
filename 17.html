	<h1>World Wide Web</h1>
			<p style="background-color:blue; color:white;">
				World Wide Web, which is also known as a Web, is a collection of websites or web pages stored in web servers
				and connected to local computers through the internet. These websites contain text pages, digital images, 
				audios, videos, etc. Users can access the content of these sites from any part of the world over the internet
				using their devices such as computers, laptops, cell phones, etc. The WWW, along with internet, enables the 
				retrieval and display of text and media to your device.
				A web page is given an online address called a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). A particular collection of web
				pages that belong to a specific URL is called a website, e.g., www.facebook.com, www.google.com, etc. So, the
				World Wide Web is like a huge electronic book whose pages are stored on multiple servers across the world.
				Small websites store all of their WebPages on a single server, but big websites or organizations place their 
				WebPages on different servers in different countries so that when users of a country search their site they 
				could get the information quickly from the nearest server.So,the World Wide Web is like a huge electronic 
				book whose pages are stored on multiple servers across the world.

				The building blocks of the Web are web pages which are formatted in HTML and connected by links called 
				"hypertext" or hyperlinks and accessed by HTTP. These links are electronic connections that link related 
				pieces of information so that users can access the desired information quickly. Hypertext offers the advantage
				to select a word or phrase from text and thus to access other pages that provide additional information 
				related to that word or phrase.So, the web provides a communication platform for users to retrieve and 
				exchange information over the internet. Unlike a book, where we move from one page to another in a sequence,
				on World Wide Web we follow a web of hypertext links to visit a web page and from that web page to move to
				other web pages. You need a browser, which is installed on your computer, to access the Web.
